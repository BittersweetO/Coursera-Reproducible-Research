Structure of data analysis(Emails example):
   - Define the question
        *Can I automatically detect emails that are SPAM that are not?
   - Define the ideal data set
        *Can I use quantitative charachteristics of emails to classify them as SPAM/HAM?
              !Descriptive - a whole population
                  *all emails in the universe
              !Exploratory - a random sample with many variables measured
                  *sample emails
              !Inferential - the right population randomly sampled
                  *careful about email sampling mechanism and the defenition pf the population that you`re sampling from
              !Predictive - a training and test data set fromm the sample population
                  *You`re going to need something like a training set and test data set from a emails population that you`re  interested in
              !Casual - data from a randomized study
                  *if I modify this component, then something else heppens. So, you`re going to need experimental data, and one type of experimental data from something like randomized trial
              !Mechanistic - data about all components of system

   - Determine what data you can access
        *Something you can find data free on the web
        *Other times you need ti buy the data
        *If the data dont exist, you may to generate iy yourself
   - Obtain the data
   - Clean the dara
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Statistical prediction/modeling
   - Interpret results
   - Challenge results
   - Sunthesize/write up results
   - Create reproducible code
